<p>I spent much of 2015 on the road, traveling and speaking extensively about education technology's histories, ideologies, and mythologies. <strong><em>The Revenge of the Monsters of Education Technology</em></strong>, a sequel to my 2014 book <em>The Monsters of Education Technology</em>, is a collection of eleven of those talks on topics ranging from teaching machines to the technlogical imperialism.</p>

<br />
<p>E-book versions are available for purchase via the usual online retailers: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B017QLPMIU">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/591492">Smashwords</a>. Even better: you can also buy from me directly <a href="https://gumroad.com/audreywatters#">via Gumroad</a>. You can purchase a <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/UJoDE#">MOBI</a>, <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/tqsJK#">ePUB</a>, or <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/hzSxg#">PDF</a> version for $4.99.</p>

<p>Coming soon: a print version as well as audiobooks for both <em>Monsters</em> publications. (When the latter is available, I will make &#8220;bundles&#8221; for sale so you can buy the e- and audiobooks together.) You can find more updates via <a href="http://monsters2.hackeducation.com/blog/">this site's blog</a>.</p>

<p>As always, thanks for supporting my work.</p>
