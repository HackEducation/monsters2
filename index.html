<p>I spent much of 2015 on the road, traveling and speaking extensively about education technology's histories, ideologies, and mythologies. <strong><em>The Revenge of the Monsters of Education Technology</em></strong>, a sequel to my 2014 book <em>The Monsters of Education Technology</em>, is a collection of eleven of those talks on topics ranging from teaching machines to the technlogical imperialism.</p>

<br />
<p>E-book versions are available for purchase via the usual online retailers: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B017QLPMIU">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/591492">Smashwords</a>. Even better: <strong>you can also buy from me directly <a href="https://gumroad.com/audreywatters#">via Gumroad</a></strong>. You can purchase the e-book there (a ZIP file that contains the MOBI, EPUB, and PDF versions) <a href="https://gumroad.com/products/hzSxg">for $4.99</a>.</p>

<p>Coming someday, maybe: a print and audiobook version. You can find more updates via <a href="http://monsters2.hackeducation.com/blog/">this site's blog</a>.</p>

<p>As always, thanks for supporting my work.</p>
