<p>I spent much of 2015 on the road, traveling and speaking extensively about education technologyâ€™s histories, ideologies, and mythologies. <strong><em>The Revenge of the Monsters of Education Technology</em></strong>, a sequel to my 2014 book <em>The Monsters of Education Technology</em>, is collection of eleven of those talks on topics ranging from teaching machines to the Californian Ideology.</p>
